-- One profile row per Supabase user. `auth.users` stays the source of identity;
-- this table holds only the values a user may edit about themselves, so provider
-- data (email, provider name, avatar) is never duplicated here.
-- These two columns are the only ones a client may write, so they are the only
-- place a client can put anything it likes. `text` alone accepts a name made of
-- spaces, a name the size of a file, and an `avatar_url` carrying a `javascript:`
-- or `data:` payload. RLS decides *whose* row may change; these decide what may
-- go in it, and nothing else in the app does.
